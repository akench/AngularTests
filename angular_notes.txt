Components:
    fundemental building block of angular aps
    display data, listen for input, take action

    to generate a Component, makes its own directory for the component
    > ng generate component {component name}


    ngOnInit = lifestyle hook, called after component is created

    to inject a component's template inside another component's template
        do <app-{component name}><app-{component name}>

    
    ** every component must be declared in exactly ONE NgModule **

    



HTML:
    {{ var }} interpolates a variable there
    {{ var_string | uppercase }} activates the UppercasePipe, which is formatting


Misc.
    [(ngModel)] is Angular's two way binding syntax

        <input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">
        binds the hero.name property to the HTML textbox, data is flowing back and forth

        must import FormsModule to use

    Decorators:
        @Component show that the thingy is a component
        @NgModule shows the top level AppModule class
